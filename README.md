# Predicting Pulmonary Fibrosis FVC Change Over Time from Baseline Patient Characteristics and CT Scans

### UC Berkeley Spring 2020 MIDS Capstone Project by Adam Johns, Marcial Nava and Tosin Akinpelu

This project was based on the Kaggle competition "OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression: Predict lung function decline" available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression

All notebooks were run on an AWS EC2 P3.2xlarge Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 16.04) Version 36.0 instance using a TensorFlow 2.3 with Python3 (CUDA 10.2 and Intel MKL-DNN) Environment.
